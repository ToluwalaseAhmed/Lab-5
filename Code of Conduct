## Code of Conduct

- This code would be for people of all ages hence the amount of profanity should be very limited so that the children do not pick up on bad things or bad words. So basically try to make everything as family friendly as possible.

- If something goes wrong while writing the code or the rules of the code of conduct is broken the offending party would have to be apologized too and disciplinary actions might be taken against the offenders. The disciplinary acion could be suspension from the project or expulsion from the project.

- This code is an easy one to help kids maybe find love in coding and maybe grow up to become very good coders. You should also try your best to be nice and welcoming to everyone because we would be working with kids very closely
